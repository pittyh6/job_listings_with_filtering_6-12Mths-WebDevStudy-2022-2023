    * Declare JavaScript Variables
        * JavaScript provides eight different data types which are undefined, null, boolean, string, symbol, bigint, number, and object.
        * Variables allow computers to store and manipulate data in a dynamic fashion. Any of the eight data types may be stored in a variable.
        * Variable names can be made up of numbers, letters, and $ or _, but may not contain spaces or start with a number.
    * Storing Values with the Assignment Operator
        *  var variableName = value;
    * Declare String Variables
        * var myName = "your name";
    * Understanding Uninitialized Variables
        * When JavaScript variables are declared, they have an initial value of undefined. 
            * If you do a mathematical operation on an undefined variable your result will be NaN which means "Not a Number". 
            * If you concatenate a string with an undefined variable, you will get a string of undefined.
    * Understanding Case Sensitivity in Variables
        * In JavaScript all variables and function names are case sensitive. This means that capitalization matters.
        * Best Practice
            * Write variable names in JavaScript in camelCase. In camelCase, multi-word variable names have the first word in lowercase and the first letter of each subsequent word is capitalized.
    
    * Explore Differences Between the var and let Keywords
        * One of the biggest problems with declaring variables with the var keyword is that you can easily overwrite variable declarations.
        * A keyword called let was introduced in ES6, a major update to JavaScript, to solve this potential issue with the var keyword.
    * Declare a Read-Only Variable with the const Keyword
        * In ES6, you can also declare variables using the const keyword.
        * const has all the awesome features that let has, with the added bonus that variables declared using const are read-only. They are a constant value, which means that once a variable is assigned with const, it cannot be reassigned:

    * add One Number to Another with JavaScript
        * var n = 5 + 10;
    * Subtract One Number from Another with JavaScript
        * const myVar = 12 - 6;
    * Multiply Two Numbers with JavaScript
        * const myVar = 13 * 13;
    * Divide One Number by Another with JavaScript
        * const myVar = 16 / 2;

    * Increment a Number with JavaScript
        * i++;
        * i = i + 1;
        * ++i;
    * Decrement a Number with JavaScript
        * i--;
        * i = i - 1;

    * Create Decimal Numbers with JavaScript
        *  Decimal numbers are sometimes referred to as floating point numbers or floats.
        *  myDecimal = 7.5;
    * Multiply Two Decimals with JavaScript
        * const product = 2.0 * 2.5;
    * Divide One Decimal by Another with JavaScript
        * const quotient = 4.4 / 2.0; 
    * Finding a Remainder in JavaScript
        * The remainder operator % gives the remainder of the division of two numbers.
        * 5 % 2 = 1 because
            Math.floor(5 / 2) = 2 (Quotient)
            2 * 2 = 4
            5 - 4 = 1 (Remainder)
        * const remainder = 11%3;
    * Compound Assignment With Augmented Addition
        * In programming, it is common to use assignments to modify the contents of a variable. Remember that everything to the right of the equals sign is evaluated first, so we can say:
            * myVar = myVar + 5;
        * One such operator is the += operator.
            * myVar += 5;
    * Compound Assignment With Augmented Subtraction
        * Like the += operator, -= subtracts a number from a variable
            * myVar -= 5;
    * Compound Assignment With Augmented Multiplication
        * The *= operator multiplies a variable by a number.
            * myVar *= 5; => myVar = myVar * 5;
    * Compound Assignment With Augmented Division
        * The /= operator divides a variable by another number.
            * myVar /= 5; => myVar = myVar / 5;
    
    * Escaping Literal Quotes in Strings
        * When you are defining a string you must start and end with a single or double quote. What happens when you need a literal quote: " or ' inside of your string?
            * In JavaScript, you can escape a quote from considering it as an end of string quote by placing a backslash (\) in front of the quote.
                * const sampleStr = "Alan said, \"Peter is learning JavaScript\".";
        * Quoting Strings with Single Quotes
            * String values in JavaScript may be written with single or double quotes, as long as you start and end with the same type of quote. Unlike some other programming languages, single and double quotes work the same in JavaScript.
                * const conversation = 'Finn exclaims to Jake, "Algebraic!"';
                * const goodStr = 'Jake asks Finn, "Hey, let\'s go on an adventure?"'; 
    * Escape Sequences in Strings
        * Quotes are not the only characters that can be escaped inside a string. There are two reasons to use escaping characters:
            * To allow you to use characters you may not otherwise be able to type out, such as a carriage return.       
            * To allow you to represent multiple quotes in a string without JavaScript misinterpreting what you mean.
                Code	Output
                \'	single quote
                \"	double quote
                \\	backslash
                \n	newline
                \r	carriage return
                \t	tab
                \b	word boundary
                \f	form feed
            * const myStr = "FirstLine\n\t\\SecondLine\nThirdLine";

    * Concatenating Strings with Plus Operator
        * In JavaScript, when the + operator is used with a String value, it is called the concatenation operator. You can build a new string out of other strings by concatenating them together.
            * 'My name is Alan,' + ' I concatenate.'
    * Concatenating Strings with the Plus Equals Operator
        * We can also use the += operator to concatenate a string onto the end of an existing string variable. This can be very helpful to break a long string over several lines.
            * let ourStr = "I come first. ";
                ourStr += "I come second.";
    * Constructing Strings with Variables
        * Sometimes you will need to build a string. By using the concatenation operator (+), you can insert one or more variables into a string you're building.
            * const ourName = "freeCodeCamp";
                const ourStr = "Hello, our name is " + ourName + ", how are you?";

    * Appending Variables to Strings
        * Just as we can build a string over multiple lines out of string literals, we can also append variables to a string using the plus equals (+=) operator.
            * const anAdjective = "awesome!";
                let ourStr = "freeCodeCamp is ";
                ourStr += anAdjective;
    * Find the Length of a String
        * You can find the length of a String value by writing .length after the string variable or string literal.
            * console.log("Alan Peter".length);
    * Use Bracket Notation to Find the First Character in a String
        * Bracket notation is a way to get a character at a specific index within a string.
        * Most modern programming languages, like JavaScript, don't start counting at 1 like humans do. They start at 0. This is referred to as Zero-based indexing
            * const firstName = "Charles";
                const firstLetter = firstName[0];
    * Understand String Immutability
        * In JavaScript, String values are immutable, which means that they cannot be altered once created.
            * let myStr = "Bob";
            myStr[0] = "J";
            - cannot change the value of myStr to Job, because the contents of myStr cannot be altered.
            - The only way to change myStr would be to assign it with a new string
            let myStr = "Bob";
            myStr = "Job";
    * Use Bracket Notation to Find the Nth Character in a String
        * secondLetterName = myName[1]
    * Use Bracket Notation to Find the Last Character in a String
        * In order to get the last letter of a string, you can subtract one from the string's length.
            * const lastLetter = firstName[firstName.length - 1];
    * Use Bracket Notation to Find the Nth-to-Last Character in a String
        * const firstName = "Augusta" 
         firstName[firstName.length - 3]
    * Word Blanks - challenge
    
    # Array
    * Store Multiple Values in one Variable using JavaScript Arrays
        * With JavaScript array variables, we can store several pieces of data in one place.
        * You start an array declaration with an opening square bracket, end it with a closing square bracket, and put a comma between each entry, like this:
            * const sandwich = ["peanut butter", "jelly", "bread"];
    * Nest one Array within Another Array
        * You can also nest arrays within other arrays, like below:
            * const teams = [["Bulls", 23], ["White Sox", 45]];
    * Access Array Data with Indexes
        * Array indexes are written in the same bracket notation that strings use, except that instead of specifying a character, they are specifying an entry in the array. Like strings, arrays use zero-based indexing, so the first element in an array has an index of 0  
            * const array = [50, 60, 70];
                console.log(array[0]);
                const data = array[1];
    * Modify Array Data With Indexes
        * Unlike strings, the entries of arrays are mutable and can be changed freely, even if the array was declared with const.
            * const ourArray = [50, 40, 30];
                ourArray[0] = 15;  -> [15, 40, 30]
    * Access Multi-Dimensional Arrays With Indexes
        * One way to think of a multi-dimensional array, is as an array of arrays. When you use brackets to access your array, the first set of brackets refers to the entries in the outer-most (the first level) array, and each additional pair of brackets refers to the next level of entries inside.
            const arr = [
              [1, 2, 3],
              [4, 5, 6],
              [7, 8, 9],
              [[10, 11, 12], 13, 14]
            ];
            const subarray = arr[3];
            const nestedSubarray = arr[3][0];
            const element = arr[3][0][1];
    # pop() and push() and shift()
    * Manipulate Arrays With push()
        * An easy way to append data to the end of an array is via the push() function.
        * .push() takes one or more parameters and "pushes" them onto the end of the array.
           const arr1 = [1, 2, 3];
            arr1.push(4);
            const arr2 = ["Stimpson", "J", "cat"];
            arr2.push(["happy", "joy"]); 
    * Manipulate Arrays With pop()
        * .pop() is used to pop a value off of the end of an array. We can store this popped off value by assigning it to a variable. In other words, .pop() removes the last element from an array and returns that element.
            * myArray = [1,2,3];
                car = myArray.pop(); -> that means car = 3
    * Manipulate Arrays With shift()
        * That's where .shift() comes in. It works just like .pop(), except it removes the first element instead of the last.
            * const ourArray = ["Stimpson", "J", ["cat"]];
                const removedFromOurArray = ourArray.shift();
    * Manipulate Arrays With unshift()
        * .unshift() works exactly like .push(), but instead of adding the element at the end of the array, unshift() adds the element at the beginning of the array.
            * const ourArray = ["Stimpson", "J", "cat"];
                ourArray.shift();
                ourArray.unshift("Happy");

    # Functions
    * Write Reusable JavaScript with Functions
        * In JavaScript, we can divide up our code into reusable parts called functions.
            * function functionName() {console.log("Hello World"); }
            * You can call or invoke this function by using its name followed by parentheses, like this: functionName();
                * function functionName() { console.log("Hello World"); }
    * Passing Values to Functions with Arguments
        * Parameters are variables that act as placeholders for the values that are to be input to a function when it is called. When a function is defined, it is typically defined along with one or more parameters. The actual values that are input (or "passed") into a function when it is called are known as arguments.
            * function testFun(param1, param2) {console.log(param1, param2); }
    * Return a Value from a Function with Return
        * We can pass values into a function with arguments. You can use a return statement to send a value back out of a function.
            * function plusThree(num) {  return num + 3;}
                const answer = plusThree(5);

    * Global Scope and Functions
        * In JavaScript, scope refers to the visibility of variables. Variables which are defined outside of a function block have Global scope. This means, they can be seen everywhere in your JavaScript code.
        * Variables which are declared without the let or const keywords are automatically created in the global scope. This can create unintended consequences elsewhere in your code or when running a function again. You should always declare your variables with let or const.
    * Local Scope and Functions
        * Variables which are declared within a function, as well as the function parameters, have local scope. That means they are only visible within that function.
            * function myTest() {
              const loc = "foo";
              console.log(loc);
            }
    * Global vs. Local Scope in Functions
        * It is possible to have both local and global variables with the same name. When you do this, the local variable takes precedence over the global variable.
            * const someVar = "Hat";
                function myFun() {
                  const someVar = "Head";
                  return someVar;
                }
    * Understanding Undefined Value returned from a Function
        * A function can include the return statement but it does not have to. In the case that the function doesn't have a return statement, when you call it, the function processes the inner code but the returned value is undefined.
            * let sum = 0;
               function addSum(num) {  sum = sum + num;}
               addSum(3);
    * Assignment with a Returned Value
        * If you'll recall from our discussion about Storing Values with the Assignment Operator, everything to the right of the equal sign is resolved before the value is assigned. This means we can take the return value of a function and assign it to a variabl
        * Assume we have pre-defined a function sum which adds two numbers together, then:
            ourSum = sum(5, 12);   
            * will call the sum function, which returns a value of 17 and assigns it to the ourSum variable.
    * Stand in Line
        * In Computer Science a queue is an abstract Data Structure where items are kept in order. New items can be added at the back of the queue and old items are taken off from the front of the queue.
    
    * Understanding Boolean Values
        * Another data type is the Boolean. Booleans may only be one of two values: true or false. They are basically little on-off switches, where true is on and false is off. These two states are mutually exclusive.
        * Note: Boolean values are never written with quotes. The strings "true" and "false" are not Boolean and have no special meaning in JavaScript.
    
    # IF statement
    * Use Conditional Logic with If Statements
        * if statements are used to make decisions in code. The keyword if tells JavaScript to execute the code in the curly braces under certain conditions, defined in the parentheses. These conditions are known as Boolean conditions and they may only be true or false.
        * When the condition evaluates to true, the program executes the statement inside the curly braces. When the Boolean condition evaluates to false, the statement inside the curly braces will not execute.
            * if (condition is true) { statement is executed }
    * Comparison with the Equality Operator
        * ==. The equality operator compares two values and returns true if they're equivalent or false if they are not. Note that equality is different from assignment (=), which assigns the value on the right of the operator to a variable on the left.
            * if (myVal == 10) { return "Equal"; }
    * Comparison with the Strict Equality Operator
        * If the values being compared have different types, they are considered unequal, and the strict equality operator will return false.
            * 3 ===  3  // true
            * 3 === '3' // false
    * Comparison with the Inequality Operator
        * The inequality operator (!=) is the opposite of the equality operator. It means not equal and returns false where equality would return true and vice versa. Like the equality operator, the inequality operator will convert data types of values while comparing.
            * 1 !=  2    // true
            * 1 != "1"   // false
            * 1 != '1'   // false
            * 1 != true  // false
            * 0 != false // false
    * Comparison with the Strict Inequality Operator
        * The strict inequality operator (!==) is the logical opposite of the strict equality operator. It means "Strictly Not Equal" and returns false where strict equality would return true and vice versa. The strict inequality operator will not convert data types.
            * 3 !==  3  // false
            * 3 !== '3' // true
            * 4 !==  3  // true
    * Comparison with the Greater Than Operator
        * The greater than operator (>) compares the values of two numbers. If the number to the left is greater than the number to the right, it returns true. Otherwise, it returns false
        * Like the equality operator, the greater than operator will convert data types of values while comparing.
            * 5   >  3  // true
            * 7   > '3' // true
            * 2   >  3  // false
            * '1' >  9  // false
    * Comparison with the Greater Than Or Equal To Operator
        * The greater than or equal to operator (>=) compares the values of two numbers. If the number to the left is greater than or equal to the number to the right, it returns true. Otherwise, it returns false.
        * Like the equality operator, the greater than or equal to operator will convert data types while comparing.
            * 6   >=  6  // true
            * 7   >= '3' // true
            * 2   >=  3  // false
            * '7' >=  9  // false
    * Comparison with the Less Than Operator
        * The less than operator (<) compares the values of two numbers. If the number to the left is less than the number to the right, it returns true. Otherwise, it returns false. Like the equality operator, the less than operator converts data types while comparing.
            * 2   < 5 // true
            * '3' < 7 // true
            * 5   < 5 // false
            * 3   < 2 // false
            * '8' < 4 // false
    * Comparison with the Less Than Or Equal To Operator
        * The less than or equal to operator (<=) compares the values of two numbers. If the number to the left is less than or equal to the number to the right, it returns true. If the number on the left is greater than the number on the right, it returns false. Like the equality operator, the less than or equal to operator converts data types.
            * 4   <= 5 // true
            * '7' <= 7 // true
            * 5   <= 5 // true
            * 3   <= 2 // false
            * '8' <= 4 // false
    * Comparisons with the Logical And Operator
        * Sometimes you will need to test more than one thing at a time. The logical and operator (&&) returns true if and only if the operands to the left and right of it are true.
            * if (num > 5 && num < 10) { return "Yes"; }
    * Comparisons with the Logical Or Operator
        * The logical or operator (||) returns true if either of the operands is true. Otherwise, it returns false.
            * if (num > 10 || num < 5) { return "No"; }
    # ELSE statement
    * Introducing Else Statements
        * When a condition for an if statement is true, the block of code following it is executed. What about when that condition is false? Normally nothing would happen. With an else statement, an alternate block of code can be executed.
            * if (num > 10) { return "Bigger than 10"; } 
                else { return "10 or Less"; }
    * Introducing Else If Statements
        * If you have multiple conditions that need to be addressed, you can chain if statements together with else if statements.
            *   if (num > 15) { return "Bigger than 15"; } 
                else if (num < 5) { return "Smaller than 5"; }
                else { return "Between 5 and 15"; }
    * Logical Order in If Else Statements
    * Chaining If Else Statements
        * if/else statements can be chained together for complex logic. Here is pseudocode of multiple chained if / else if statements:
            * if (condition1) {
                  statement1
                } else if (condition2) {
                  statement2
                } else if (condition3) {
                  statement3
                . . .
                } else {
                  statementN
                }
    
    # SWITCH
    * Selecting from Many Options with Switch Statements
        * If you have many options to choose from, use a switch statement. A switch statement tests a value and can have many case statements which define various possible values. Statements are executed from the first matched case value until a break is encountered.
        * switch (lowercaseLetter) {
              case "a":
                console.log("A");
                break;
              case "b":
                console.log("B");
                break;
            }
        * case values are tested with strict equality (===). The break tells JavaScript to stop executing statements. If the break is omitted, the next statement will be executed.  
    * Adding a Default Option in Switch Statements
        * In a switch statement you may not be able to specify all possible values as case statements. Instead, you can add the default statement which will be executed if no matching case statements are found. Think of it like the final else statement in an if/else chain.
         * switch (num) {
              case value1:
                statement1;
                break;
              case value2:
                statement2;
                break;
            ...
              default:
                defaultStatement;
                break;
            }
    * Multiple Identical Options in Switch Statements
        *   If the break statement is omitted from a switch statement's case, the following case statement(s) are executed until a break is encountered. If you have multiple inputs with the same output, you can represent them in a switch statement like this:
            * let result = "";
                switch (val) {
                  case 1:
                  case 2:
                  case 3:
                    result = "1, 2, or 3";
                    break;
                  case 4:
                    result = "4 alone";
                }
    * Replacing If Else Chains with Switch

    # return Function
    * Returning Boolean Values from Functions
        * You may recall from Comparison with the Equality Operator that all comparison operators return a boolean true or false value.
            function isEqual(a, b) {
              if (a === b) {
                return true;
              } else {
                return false;
              }
            }
        * Since === returns true or false, we can return the result of the comparison:
            * function isEqual(a, b) {
                return a === b;
              }
    * Return Early Pattern for Functions
        * When a return statement is reached, the execution of the current function stops and control returns to the calling location.
    
    # OBJECTS
    * Build JavaScript Objects
        * Objects are similar to arrays, except that instead of using indexes to access and modify their data, you access the data in objects through what are called properties.
        * Objects are useful for storing data in a structured way, and can represent real world objects
            * const cat = {
                  "name": "Whiskers",
                  "legs": 4,
                  "tails": 1,
                  "enemies": ["Water", "Dogs"]
              };
        * In this example, all the properties are stored as strings, such as name, legs, and tails. However, you can also use numbers as properties. You can even omit the quotes for single-word string properties, as follows:
            * const anotherObject = {
                  make: "Ford",
                  5: "five",
                  "model": "focus"
              };
        * However, if your object has any non-string properties, JavaScript will automatically typecast them as strings.
    * Accessing Object Properties with Dot Notation
        * There are two ways to access the properties of an object: dot notation (.) and bracket notation ([]), similar to an array.
        * Dot notation is what you use when you know the name of the property you're trying to access ahead of time.
            * const myObj = {
                  prop1: "val1",
                  prop2: "val2"
              };
              const prop1val = myObj.prop1;
              const prop2val = myObj.prop2;
    * Accessing Object Properties with Bracket Notation
        * The second way to access the properties of an object is bracket notation ([]). If the property of the object you are trying to access has a space in its name, you will need to use bracket notation.
        * However, you can still use bracket notation on object properties without spaces.
            * const myObj = {
              "Space Name": "Kirk",
              "More Space": "Spock",
              "NoSpace": "USS Enterprise"
            };
            myObj["Space Name"];
            myObj['More Space'];
            myObj["NoSpace"];
    * Accessing Object Properties with Variables
        * Another use of bracket notation on objects is to access a property which is stored as the value of a variable. This can be very useful for iterating through an object's properties or when accessing a lookup table.
        * const dogs = {
            Fido: "Mutt",
            Hunter: "Doberman",
            Snoopie: "Beagle"
          };
          const myDog = "Hunter";
          const myBreed = dogs[myDog];
          console.log(myBreed);
        * The string Doberman would be displayed in the console.
        * Note that we do not use quotes around the variable name when using it to access the property because we are using the value of the variable, not the name.
    * Updating Object Properties
        * After you've created a JavaScript object, you can update its properties at any time just like you would update any other variable. You can use either dot or bracket notation to update.
            * const ourDog = {
              "name": "Camper",
              "legs": 4,
              "tails": 1,
              "friends": ["everything!"]
            };
        * Here's how we update his object's name property: ourDog.name = "Happy Camper"; or ourDog["name"] = "Happy Camper"; Now when we evaluate ourDog.name, instead of getting Camper, we'll get his new name, Happy Camper.   
            * ourDog.name = "Happy Camper"; or ourDog["name"] = "Happy Camper";
    * Add New Properties to a JavaScript Object
        * You can add new properties to existing JavaScript objects the same way you would modify them.
            * ourDog.bark = "bow-wow"; OR 
            ourDog["bark"] = "bow-wow";
    * Delete Properties from a JavaScript Object
        *   We can also delete properties from objects like this:
            * delete ourDog.bark;  
    * Using Objects for Lookups
        * Objects can be thought of as a key/value storage, like a dictionary. If you have tabular data, you can use an object to lookup values rather than a switch statement or an if/else chain. This is most useful when you know that your input data is limited to a certain range.
            * const alpha = {
                  1:"Z",
                  2:"Y",
                  3:"X",
                  4:"W",
                  ...
                  24:"C",
                  25:"B",
                  26:"A"
              };
              const thirdLetter = alpha[2];
              const lastLetter = alpha[24];
              const value = 2;
              const valueLookup = alpha[value];
    * Testing Objects for Properties
        * Sometimes it is useful to check if the property of a given object exists or not. We can use the .hasOwnProperty(propname) method of objects to determine if that object has the given property name. .hasOwnProperty() returns true or false if the property is found or not.
            * const myObj = {
                top: "hat",
                bottom: "pants"
              };
              myObj.hasOwnProperty("top");
              myObj.hasOwnProperty("middle");
    * Manipulating Complex Objects
        * Sometimes you may want to store data in a flexible Data Structure. A JavaScript object is one way to handle flexible data. They allow for arbitrary combinations of strings, numbers, booleans, arrays, functions, and objects.
            * const ourMusic = [
                {
                  "artist": "Daft Punk",
                  "title": "Homework",
                  "release_year": 1997,
                  "formats": [ 
                    "CD", 
                    "Cassette", 
                    "LP"
                  ],
                  "gold": true
                }
              ];
    * Accessing Nested Objects
        * The sub-properties of objects can be accessed by chaining together the dot or bracket notation.
            * const ourStorage = {
                 "desk": {
                   "drawer": "stapler"
                 },
                 "cabinet": {
                   "top drawer": { 
                     "folder1": "a file",
                     "folder2": "secrets"
                   },
                   "bottom drawer": "soda"
                 }
               };
               ourStorage.cabinet["top drawer"].folder2;
               ourStorage.desk.drawer;
                * ourStorage.cabinet["top drawer"].folder2 would be the string secrets, and ourStorage.desk.drawer would be the string stapler.
    * Accessing Nested Arrays
        * As we have seen in earlier examples, objects can contain both nested objects and nested arrays. Similar to accessing nested objects, array bracket notation can be chained to access nested arrays.
            * const ourPets = [
                {
                  animalType: "cat",
                  names: [
                    "Meowzer",
                    "Fluffy",
                    "Kit-Cat"
                  ]
                },
                {
                  animalType: "dog",
                  names: [
                    "Spot",
                    "Bowser",
                    "Frankie"
                  ]
                }
              ];
              ourPets[0].names[1];
              ourPets[1].names[0];
              * ourPets[0].names[1] would be the string Fluffy, 
              * and ourPets[1].names[0] would be the string Spot.

    # LOOPS
    * Iterate with JavaScript While Loops
        * You can run the same code multiple times by using a loop.
        * The first type of loop we will learn is called a while loop because it runs while a specified condition is true and stops once that condition is no longer true.
            * const ourArray = [];
              let i = 0;
              while (i < 5) {
                ourArray.push(i);
                i++;
              }
    * Iterate with JavaScript For Loops
        * You can run the same code multiple times by using a loop.
        * The most common type of JavaScript loop is called a for loop because it runs for a specific number of times.
        * For loops are declared with three optional expressions separated by semicolons:
        * for (a; b; c), where a is the initialization statement, b is the condition statement, and c is the final expression
            * const ourArray = [];
              for (let i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
                ourArray.push(i);
              }
    * Iterate Odd Numbers With a For Loop
        * For loops don't have to iterate one at a time. By changing our final-expression, we can count by even numbers.
        * We'll start at i = 0 and loop while i < 10. We'll increment i by 2 each loop with i += 2.
            * for (let i = 0; i < 10; i += 2) {
                ourArray.push(i); }
    * Count Backwards With a For Loop
        * A for loop can also count backwards, so long as we can define the right conditions.
        * In order to decrement by two each iteration, we'll need to change our initialization, condition, and final expression.
        * We'll start at i = 10 and loop while i > 0. We'll decrement i by 2 each loop with i -= 2
            * for (let i = 10; i > 0; i -= 2) {
                ourArray.push(i);
              }
    * Iterate Through an Array with a For Loop
        * A common task in JavaScript is to iterate through the contents of an array. One way to do that is with a for loop. This code will output each element of the array arr to the console:
            * const arr = [10, 9, 8, 7, 6];
            for (let i = 0; i < arr.length; i++) {
               console.log(arr[i]);
            }
    * Nesting For Loops
        * If you have a multi-dimensional array, you can use the same logic as the prior waypoint to loop through both the array and any sub-arrays.
            * const arr = [
                [1, 2], [3, 4], [5, 6]
              ];
              for (let i = 0; i < arr.length; i++) {
                for (let j = 0; j < arr[i].length; j++) {
                  console.log(arr[i][j]);
                }
              }
                * This outputs each sub-element in arr one at a time. Note
    * Iterate with JavaScript Do...While Loops
        * It is called a do...while loop because it will first do one pass of the code inside the loop no matter what, and then continue to run the loop while the specified condition evaluates to true.
            * const ourArray = [];
              let i = 0;
              do {
                ourArray.push(i);
                i++;
              } while (i < 5);
    * Replace Loops using Recursion
        * Recursion is the concept that a function can be expressed in terms of itself. To help understand this, start by thinking about the following task: multiply the first n elements of an array to create the product of those elements.
            * function multiply(arr, n) {
                if (n <= 0) {
                  return 1;
                } else {
                  return multiply(arr, n - 1) * arr[n - 1];
                }
              }
              * Recursive functions must have a base case when they return without calling the function again (in this example, when n <= 0), otherwise they can never finish executing.
    
    # RANDOM
    * Generate Random Fractions with JavaScript
        * Random numbers are useful for creating random behavior.
        * JavaScript has a Math.random() function that generates a random decimal number between 0 (inclusive) and 1 (exclusive). Thus Math.random() can return a 0 but never return a 1.
    * Generate Random Whole Numbers with JavaScript
        * 1) Use Math.random() to generate a random decimal.
          2) Multiply that random decimal by 20.
          3) Use another function, Math.floor() to round the number down to its nearest whole number.
            * Remember that Math.random() can never quite return a 1 and, because we're rounding down, it's impossible to actually get 20. This technique will give us a whole number between 0 and 19.
                * Math.floor(Math.random() * 20);
    * Generate Random Whole Numbers within a Range
        * Instead of generating a random whole number between zero and a given number like we did before, we can generate a random whole number that falls within a range of two specific numbers.
        * To do this, we'll define a minimum number min and a maximum number max.
        * Math.floor(Math.random() * (max - min + 1)) + min

    # PARSEINT
    * Use the parseInt Function
        * The parseInt() function parses a string and returns an integer.
            * const a = parseInt("007");
            * The above function converts the string 007 to the integer 7. If the first character in the string can't be converted into a number, then it returns NaN.
    * Use the parseInt Function with a Radix
        * The parseInt() function parses a string and returns an integer. It takes a second argument for the radix, which specifies the base of the number in the string. The radix can be an integer between 2 and 36.
            * parseInt(string, radix);

    # Conditional (Ternary)
    * Use the Conditional (Ternary) Operator
        * The conditional operator, also called the ternary operator, can be used as a one line if-else expression.
        * The syntax is a ? b : c, where a is the condition, b is the code to run when the condition returns true, and c is the code to run when the condition returns false.
            * function findGreater(a, b) {
                return a > b ? "a is greater" : "b is greater or equal";
              }
    * Use Multiple Conditional (Ternary) Operators
        * You can also chain them together to check for multiple conditions.
            * function findGreaterOrEqual(a, b) {
                return (a === b) ? "a and b are equal" 
                  : (a > b) ? "a is greater" 
                  : "b is greater";
              }
        * It is considered best practice to format multiple conditional operators such that each condition is on a separate line, as shown above. Using multiple conditional operators without proper indentation may make your code hard to read.
